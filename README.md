Replication materials for "A Comparative Approach to Explaining Gender Disparities in Asian American and Asian Canadian Politics" (Lu, F. 2024)

"2020 APAICS.csv" and "2021 APAICS.csv" are original datasets downloaded from https://www.apaics.org/aapi-candidate-pipeline

"combinedAPAICS_FLu_2024" in .xls and .dta formats are used in analysis of Asian American candidates. 

"APAICS_analysis.do" is the Stata do-file used in analysis of Asian American candidates.

"BIPOC_Canada.do" is the Stata do-file used in analysis of Asian Canadian candidates.

Please contact me at fan.lu@queensu.ca if you want access to the dataset of Asian Canadian candidates. Since this dataset is based on a database compiled by Johnson, Tolley, Thomas and Bodet (2021), I do not feel comfortable posting it publicly.
